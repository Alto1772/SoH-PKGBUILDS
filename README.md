# SoH-PKGBUILDS

The goal is to install [SoH](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/ShipWright) on Arch Linux (& derivatives) as a system package with icons for easy launch access. Installation resides at `/opt/soh/`.

Both the main **soh** and **soh-git** package don't require a rom to build (unless build is interrupted and errors out with missing headers), only the **soh-otr** packages needs it.
